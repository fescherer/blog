This blog post is my journey into Game Off 2023 by Github and Lee Reilly, started on November 01 and ended December 01. It's my very first big game project, I am so exited! I will update this page every day, telling what I did and the expectations to the next day.

## Day 01

I was so excited to participate. I remember only making one game in Javascript very simple, three or four years ago, I think using [P5](https://p5js.org), It was a runner game, like the [Google's Chrome Dinossaur Game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dinosaur_Game), very nice, but I think something more complex.

This day was the great theme reveal, which was *Scale*. It was very nice, very embracing. The first moment I thought in making something like [Cuphead](https://store.steampowered.com/app/268910/Cuphead), a boss battle rush themed as [pirate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Age_of_Piracy) or other theme related to sea that I can fit [scales](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scale_(anatomy)).

![Print showing Game's Off Site Scale theme description](https://github.com/fescherer/blog/assets/62115215/dedf7b77-3049-44d9-a724-47bcbea0eddc)

Thinking more about, a boss battle rush would be very difficult for my first game because I need to create a lot of mechanics, and in one month maybe it's not possible. So I dicided to go to [scale, an increasing stuff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scale_(ratio)). I thought in games like [Vampire Survivors](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1794680/?snr=1_5_9__205), a bullet hell game. Maybe I cannot do a lot of enemies variations, but I think I will go if this.

## Day 02

This day I was searching for a game engine. As I only code one game, I do not have an expertise of how game engine is better for my choices, so I take a time to study some of the engines recommended in the Game Off 2023 page. I started in [Unity](https://unity.com), It's a very good engine to design first games because it's simple and intuitive.

I also look at [Unreal](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US), with a very good lighting system and incredible stuff to handle 3D games it's probably the best engine out there for someone trying a next gen game, but for me that is my first game, and will probably be a 2D game, Unreal would be kill a mosquito with a bazuca, and for this, Unreal will not be my choice.

The last engine I tryed was [Godot](https://godotengine.org), a very good engine open source that you can create 2D and 3D games, but I think the greater part is for 2D games. Godot has a scripting language called [GDScript](https://godotengine.org/features/#script) with a very simple syntax inspired mostly by [Python](https://www.python.org), a programming language that I used a lot on my side projects.

In the end I chose Godot, mostly because GDScript is so similar to Python that I had the better experience of the three ones. Godot is also intuitive, and I think my challenge in the next days will learn everthing about Godot and create the game.

I had a little extra time in this day, and started to learn about Godot using the Godot's fundamental's playlist in the [Game Dev Artisan channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6YNKi3hcS5U&list=PLrnWJKR7bTuw7L0g70GzCM-cUr9XmtnAp).

## Day 03

This was a not good day. I mostly study how to use Godot, I learned to create collision and pickup items, but I tryeed to refactor my files and I delete my Player with all the animations and logic already finished 🥲🥲🥲. I stoped and I hope tomorrow will be a better day.

Well at late night I thought better and decided to start a new project, this time, with a better preparation, and clarification of the ideas. I started searching in the assets I downloaded at [Ichio.io](https://itch.io/game-assets). I found a very good collection with free license [Ninja Adventure](https://pixel-boy.itch.io/ninja-adventure-asset-pack), it has a full set of incredible pixel art with event dialog faces that I can use in the buy menu. The next step was think of what type of game I wanted and maybe, a tower defence it's really nice and I can reuse some code to other enemies. Other point is the map, I just need to create one for this first time.

To get started I search in the assets pack and decided the towers. Of course I can have a lot of towers, but the game is scope is to be small and finishable until December, so I cut and decided to create only 6 towers, each one being unique and having a upgraded version.

And when thinking of enemies, I would like to show the first boss early because, the objective is to create a simple game, so I decided to separate into 20 levels and each level will have a new enemy. Maybe I will change this in the future and just have 4 levels with a longer duration each one with a boss in the end. I don't know, and we will see what I end doing. For now, the level are these:

Level|Slot|Slot|Slot|Slot|Slot|Boss

The main ideia is that each tower can be good/bad to a enemy type. For example the Knight tower is only able to damage near enemies but can deal area damage, so It's good to enemies that come in groups(Mostly land), on the other hand the Mage tower has single shot and far distance, which is good to fast and single enemies(Mostly air).

## Day 04

This day I was little busy playing tennis with my brother and my girlfriend. Was the first time we played, it's nice, but tiring. Anyways, in the spare time I worked at creating the project on Godot (I know it still has the songs and tiles, but this I choose later). This time I looked a lot in the [Godot Documentation](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/index.html) therefore I don't have much to say, I mostly just studied.

## Day 05

Today is Sunday, so I have all the time to play around with the game bulding. I started to follow a Youtube series [from Game Development Center](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFdpCGbrVXI&list=PLZ-54sd-DMAJltIzTtZ6ZhC-9hkqYXyp6), it's a bit out of date, but we can get a very good ideia to how tower defence games are.

The first classes is to structure the project and make the first configurations on Godot. He said that we can reuse this to future projects.

First, the folder struture. It is separated in 6 folders, the first one beeing the `Assets`, that is branched into `Environment`, `Icons` and `UI`, everthing autoexplaning. Inside the `Environment` we have `Props`(Files with one asset per file) and `Tilesets`(Files with two or more assets in). The `Licenses` is where you store license of fonts, assets and evething else. The `Resources` is objects that will be reused on project. The Scenes is where will be store all the objects(Classes) created. Lastely we have Singletons, objects that are independent from the rest of project.

Other thing I did is the first map, I finally learned about [tilesets](https://docs.godotengine.org/pt-br/4.x/classes/class_tileset.html). Following the documentation and the [video of Game Development Center](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SIQKpBCmkvk) I finally make the first map using some scalable tecniques like make terrains.

Terrains for now is just used to create roads, that using assets Godot can automatically find the right asset to that road, this way I don't need to find the right asset to that corner on the road. I followed [this tutorial by Maker Tech](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6aVQ2ylMrU).

The map has still really poor flora and I want to trees like terrains, to  be more efficient in creating forests (If you pay attention, there are some tiles with bugged trees). In general was a very productive game. If I hope I can keep up this rithm.

## Day 06

This day I was busy with some stuff and could not make any progress 🥲🥲🥲

## Day 07

I know I should give more attention to the map, but everything seems kind weird. The scale doesn't seems right. That's because I need to confirm that the scale is right to create the map based on. So I decided to create the first tower of the game, thinking mostly in adapt the scale (Spoiler *I did not have the time to play with the scale*).

Anyways, I started with `node2D` and then put the sprite inside, I don't know if this is the best practice, but for me, giving a wrapper of `node2D` makes me feel more organized. The sprite for now will be the idle:

One thing is that it has right, left, bottom and top sides, which gives me the necessity to turn the sprite as the enemy changes it's direction. I started trying the sprite to follow my mouse, after many tries, I came with a simple code, but I happy that I can undestand everthing from this code. 😁

```python
extends Node2D

var direction = Vector2(0, 0)

func _physics_process(delta):
  turn()

func turn():
  var target_position = get_global_mouse_position()
  var character_position = global_position
  direction = (target_position - character_position).normalized()

  if(direction.x > abs(direction.y)):
    get_node("Knight").set_frame(3)
  elif direction.x < -abs(direction.y):
    get_node("Knight").set_frame(2)
  elif direction.y > abs(direction.x):
    get_node("Knight").set_frame(0)
  else:
    get_node("Knight").set_frame(1)
```

## Day 08, 09, 10 and 11

I am gonna group all these days together because I really did not have a lot of time to progress in the game and the little time I had was trying to make the map looks a little bit better. It was really hard, not because the sprites, they are awesome, it's because of me, I did not have and experience grouping those tiles together in a pleasent way to the eye. I don't know, I was looking for a diverse map, having the flower, ice, rocky and forest parts, but I don't know, something looks out of place.

## Day 12

This day I created another tower and rescale the ***knight*** already created to fit better in the map. It was very nice, I learned about scaling and import pixel art in Godot 4. I also put a base in tower to better hightlight on map.

The code part was very easy, following the tutorial [Game Development Center](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHGEiQhR1PQ&list=PLZ-54sd-DMAJltIzTtZ6ZhC-9hkqYXyp6&index=3) I just imported the logic from a generic class.

## Day 13

It was a very short day. The only thing I could do was the main menu. I was following the video of Game Development Center, but in Gotot 4, some methods have changed, main thing is to **connect** now is deprecated and we need to use something like `[Node].[Signal].connect([method])` insted of `.connect([signal], [object], [method]`

## Day 14

This is one more busy day, I just make some initial HUD, following the same tutorial of [Game Development Center](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X5YsM-dLbCA&list=PLZ-54sd-DMAJltIzTtZ6ZhC-9hkqYXyp6&index=4). It was kinda simple because this hud doesn't do anything else, it's just two images.

I used the assets of [Ninja's Adventure](https://pixel-boy.itch.io/ninja-adventure-asset-pack) again, they are just wonderfull, I just need to make them smaller, but this is problem for other day.

## Day 15, 16 and 17

These days I found a very big problem 😓. At day 15 I was intended to do the fifth part of the [Game Development Center Godot's tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9W4zVD-kOwU&list=PLZ-54sd-DMAJltIzTtZ6ZhC-9hkqYXyp6&index=6), but there were a lot of different things I did in the project that I was getting the consequences. Like the resolution of 1280x720 is too big for a 16x16 assets of [Ninja's Adventure](https://pixel-boy.itch.io/ninja-adventure-asset-pack), so I tried to add scale and messed with everthing else, now, 4 tiles were supposed to be just 1, and the collision system was not working and I knew I needed to make a work around that I would not like.

So after trying many strategies, I just stopped 😕.

## Day 18

I was so frustated because of bugs that I decided not think about it today.

## Day 19, 20 and 21

Even if I was frustrated, I have not given up, and would make the game from zero if necessary. And so I did, not everthing, but I can guarantee was a lot.

One of the many problems was the scale, resolution and sprite sizes. The problem I had was a pixelart game with assets of 16x16 that was running on a resolution of 1280x720 which are 1280/16 * 720/16 = **3,600** tiles to fill the entire screen. Think about it, every sprite is 16x16, *even the towers* which in the 3600 tiles, max 10 would be towers, of course this will cause a strange sensation, ***it's not in the right scale***. To solve this, I scale some arts, like the towers and bases, this way, a tower had 1 tile size, but the path was 3 tiles size. You can imagine the problem when making collisions.

To solve this, I changed the ***Viewport width and height*** to something way smaller (**320x192**) and put the ***Window Width and height Override*** to 3 times of the **Viewport size**. This way, the game will have a resolution of 320x192 and will open in a window of 960x576, making all the scale for me. The game now doesn't needed to scale some arts, everthing from enemies, path and towers will be 16x16 and just one tile. I did a small change on the [Ninja's Adventure' assets](https://pixel-boy.itch.io/ninja-adventure-asset-pack) because some tiles were way to big for me, and then I made them smaller (Logs and a type of grass).

![image](https://github.com/fescherer/blog/assets/62115215/e71883a2-56cf-43b0-addc-49873b9fd0bf)

![image](https://github.com/fescherer/blog/assets/62115215/8804a239-4187-4f20-8a73-b5ec86cfd2f7)

Now using a resolution of 320x192 gives us 320/16 * 192/16 = **240** tiles only. It may look way to little, but is not. I feel I can make better maps with this size.

Of course this brought me a lot of more problems 🥲. All the assets in the scenes were with wrong sizes and so I went in every scene fixing the bugs (towers, map, ui, menu, everthing 🥲. If you are starting as me, just make sure the scale is right 😅).

In this process I redid the menu, ui and the map. Here is the final result:

*Note*: I lerned how to animate some sprites in the map 🤩🤩🤩.
