## Day 01

I was so excited to participate. In this day I search for assets and what engine I would make my first game. The theme was reveled too. It is *Scale*.

## Day 02

In this day I started learned about Godot's fundamental's in the [Game Dev Artisan channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6YNKi3hcS5U&list=PLrnWJKR7bTuw7L0g70GzCM-cUr9XmtnAp). I leaned how to import assets and first movement of the character. probably in the final version, everthing will be different.
