This blog post is my journey into Game Off 2023 by Github and Lee Reilly, started on November 01 and ended December 01. It's my very first big game project, I am so exited! I will update this page every day, telling what I did and the expectations to the next day.

## Day 01

I was so excited to participate. I remember only making one game in Javascript very simple, three or four years ago, I think using [P5](https://p5js.org), It was a runner game, like the [Google's Chrome Dinossaur Game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dinosaur_Game), very nice, but I think something more complex.

This day was the great theme reveal, which was *Scale*. It was very nice, very embracing. The first moment I thought in making something like [Cuphead](https://store.steampowered.com/app/268910/Cuphead), a boss battle rush themed as [pirate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Age_of_Piracy) or other theme related to sea that I can fit [scales](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scale_(anatomy)).

Thinking more about, a boss battle rush would be very difficult for my first game because I need to create a lot of mechanics, and in one month maybe it's not possible. So I dicided to go to [scale, an increasing stuff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scale_(ratio)). I thought in games like [Vampire Survivors](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1794680/?snr=1_5_9__205), a bullet hell game. Maybe I cannot do a lot of enemies variations, but I think I will go if this.

## Day 02

This day I was searching for a game engine. As I only code one game, I do not have an expertise of how game engine is better for my choices, so I take a time to study some of the engines recommended in the Game Off 2023 page. I started in [Unity](https://unity.com), It's a very good engine to design first games because it's simple and intuitive.

I also look at [Unreal](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US), with a very good lighting system and incredible stuff to handle 3D games it's probably the best engine out there for someone trying a next gen game, but for me that is my first game, and will probably be a 2D game, Unreal would be kill a mosquito with a bazuca, and for this, Unreal will not be my choice.

The last engine I tryed was [Godot](https://godotengine.org), a very good engine open source that you can create 2D and 3D games, but I think the greater part is for 2D games. Godot has a scripting language called [GDScript](https://godotengine.org/features/#script) with a very simple syntax inspired mostly by [Python](https://www.python.org), a programming language that I used a lot on my side projects.

In the end I chose Godot, mostly because GDScript is so similar to Python that I had the better experience of the three ones. Godot is also intuitive, and I think my challenge in the next days will learn everthing about Godot and create the game.

I had a little extra time in this day, and started to learn about Godot using the Godot's fundamental's playlist in the [Game Dev Artisan channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6YNKi3hcS5U&list=PLrnWJKR7bTuw7L0g70GzCM-cUr9XmtnAp).

## Day 03

This was a not good day. I mostly study how to use Godot, I learned to create collision and pickup items, but I tryeed to refactor my files and I delete my Player with all the animations and logic already finished ðŸ¥²ðŸ¥²ðŸ¥². I stoped and I hope tomorrow will be a better day.
