In my opinion one of the most difficult part in frontend is to make the layout look similar in every browser and that's because we have CSS Resets, but scrollbars can be one of the points we can forget but can makes a huge difference to users.

## Extensions.json

At my first year as developer, I always will remember a gaffe committed when introducing some new features I had developed to the CEO's company. Well, I use Mozilla Developer Edition to code, but at that time I forgot the most users use Chrome, and so the CEO. Yes, the feature showed was horrible in Chrome because the scrollbars are not aesthetic as Firefox. In the end, was no problem, the CEO just pointed this out and I did the fix in the next patch.

The point is scrollbars can not be neglected,


- Every browser has issues-
I don't like how Firefox "grows" the scrollbar on hover only on it, I think if it has to grow, that should grow on hover the content to be easy accessed and not the scrollbar

- Chromium browsers has a lot of similar things, including the scrollbar, but the majority it's so ugly and big. I think the only exception would be the Edge, yes the successor of Internet Explorer, Edge has a very like Chrome scrollbar but more rounded and a little bit more thin. But even that, I think can be thinner

On mobile, the scrollbar do not need to be that big, because the scroll is supposed to work on every part of content not only the scrollbar, much like the proper mouse scroll. So I do not see a reason to these scrollbars be so big


Other problem is the width of the scrollbar actually being count on the width size of the content only on Chromium browsers, on the other hand, Mozilla does not count as actually width of the content, so WHY?, can you just have a common standard Mozilla and Chromium


## Additional tips

One very interesting stuff I found by searching content for this article is a solution for components that has a special css for hovering effects, is to use `media query hover` to only enable this on hover support devices.
